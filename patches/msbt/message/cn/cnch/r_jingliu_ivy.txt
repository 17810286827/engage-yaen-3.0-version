Jingliu, there is something I wish to say.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#002]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Then speak it plainly.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#003]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
I have come to respect you. Not merely as a warrior,
but also as someone who understands burdens.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#004]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Even though I told you that I'm a traitor, that I've
killed many of my former soldiers?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#005]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Our circumstances are different, yes, but I was
once labeled a traitor to Elusia.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#006]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
As a result, I had to strike down many Elusian
soldiers for a time.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#007]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Hm. You surprise me, Princess. Few would admit
to valuing shared pain.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#008]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Pain unspoken festers. But shared, it forges bonds.
Unexpected ones, but bonds nonetheless.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#009]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Wise words for a future ruler, but our lives are
and will be forever different.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#010]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Still, I find it strange that I find some reassurance
in those very words.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#011]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Quite strange, isn't it? To find interest in another's
company...$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#012]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
And should your tether ever tighten too much,
I will do what I can to loosen it.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#013]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Then in return, if you find yourself too adrift,
I can offer a word or two of advice.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#014]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
An unlikely alliance, but I appreciate your attitude
regardless.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#015]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
While we're at it, I am also appreciative for both
your understanding and your strength.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#016]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
It will be lent for a short while until I return home
and see my plan through once and for all.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#017]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Then, I wish you the best of luck for when that
time arrives.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#018]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
And hopefully the people of your homeland will
accept you again, just as mine have accepted me.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#019]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
I highly doubt it, though I do find myself curious
as to how my old student would react.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#020]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
But I'll keep the possibility at the back of my mind,
so thanks.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#021]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
And make sure that you never let your mind or
body falter like I once did.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#022]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
I'll try my best, Jingliu.$Wait(0)

Gazing out into the horizon, are we?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#002]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Jingliu!...I have much work left to do today and
felt that I needed a break.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#003]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Your sense of duty—it seems to drive you relentlessly.
Why?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#004]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Well...duty is the only constant in my life.
Without it, I am...untethered.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#005]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
And that tether? Does it not choke as much as it
guides?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#006]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
This is quite sudden, but...I suppose it does.
To let it go would leave me adrift.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#007]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Allowing yourself to be leashed by feelings will
only drag you down in the long term.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#008]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
We all have them. Even now, I would be surprised
if you weren't holding onto one.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#009]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Knowing you and your long life, I would also imagine
it to be quite complex.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#010]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Perhaps it is, but what of it?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#011]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Tell me, what is your tether? It's only fair that
I get to ask in turn.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#012]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Regret. Anger. The desire that my blade shall
vanquish the Aeons once and for all.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#013]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Was it due to the tragedy you mentioned?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#014]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
That was a contributing factor and only because
I escalated the ensuing situation.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#015]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Then we are alike, though our reasons differ. Two
people bound by what we cannot relinquish.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#016]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
And weighed down by pasts that we might have
avoided with different choices.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#017]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
That's a stretch to say, but there are indeed
small parallels between our lives.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#018]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Do you ever dream of severing those tethers?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#019]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
No. I have a goal that I must see to its end, and
even on the day I fulfill it, I cannot turn back.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#020]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
I have been deemed a traitor in my own homeland,
and all the people who know me now despise me.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#021]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Is there truly no room for reconciliation? To
settle down when all is said and done?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#022]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
If you continue to insist, there is one last option I'm
considering.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#023]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
And that is?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#024]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Just before I was taken away to this land, a traveler
approached me.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#025]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
He claimed that he had the means to slay the Aeon
of Abundance.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#026]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Doing so would free myself and all others from
the curse of madness that I carry.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#027]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Yet each time I consider his offer, I wonder if
freedom would be worth the emptiness.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#028]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Well, I can't say I understand your whole story,
but I am glad that you are making an effort.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#029]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
And I don't think you'd be empty, for one. You
seem strong enough to make those wrongs right.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#030]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Whether I feel like it or not is a different story.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#031]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Though perhaps we should sever our own binds first
before we begin to lecture each other. $Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#032]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
I agree, even if that means that won't be happening
anytime soon for either of us.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#001]

$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
...Jingliu. Are you...staring at me?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#002]
$Window(0, "PID_Jingliu", "1")
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
I was simply intrigued by your composure.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#003]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
My composure? I'm not sure I understand.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#004]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
The way you carry yourself—calm, deliberate.
A veil over emotions. It's...familiar.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#005]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Is that supposed to be a compliment or criticism?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#006]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Neither, merely an observation. You mask your
burdens well, as though it were an art..$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#007]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
The way you fight so recklessly, you must be
carrying some burdens yourself..$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#008]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
True enough. Both of us have pasts that continue
to weigh us down.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#009]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
For me, it was when a close friend perished.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#010]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
In their desperation, the others made decisions
that had unfathomable consequences.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#011]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
That said, do you believe yourself to have the
emotional intelligence to rule in the right mind?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#012]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Is that your way of prying into my past or simply
testing my resolve?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#013]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Neither. I seek only to ascertain the intents of the
person before me.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#014]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
A curious approach. I thought you'd judge a person
by their sword, not their burdens.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#015]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Burdens weigh on the blade. Knowing them lends
clarity to one's strength and weakness.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#016]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
...$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#017]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Then to answer your question, not quite.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#018]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
But I have my allies by my side who will help me
make the right decisions as a ruler.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#019]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
As for you, Jingliu. Where were you when these
friends of yours acted in desperation?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#020]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
I was not immediately present when Dan Feng
attempted to revive Baiheng.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#021]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
But this is not a contest of tragedies.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#022]
$Window(2, "PID_アイビー")
Perhaps not, but if you see behind my mask, I cannot
help but want to see behind yours.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#023]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Heh. A fair point, Princess.$Wait(0)
