[MID_AFTER_Jingliu_Text]
Jingliu suddenly disappeared at
the end of the war and returned
back to her home world, yet her
presence and feats would be
forgotten by all in Lythos.

Jingliu would go on to surrender
herself to the Xianzhou Alliance,
but this opportunity allowed her
to meet with her old companions.
