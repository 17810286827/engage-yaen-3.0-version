It truly has been a long time since I was last able

From what you told me, your homeland is a massive
flagship, right?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#006]
$Window(2, "PID_オルテンシア")
These Elusian hotsprings are completely natural
and we have Goldmary's family to thank for them...$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#007]
$Window(2, "PID_オルテンシア")
So I'm not exactly sure if they can be remade so
easily or even naturally in your world.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#008]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
From where I come from, traveling around the stars
is a simple feat.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#009]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
It allows for interastral trade and services to fluorish,

Dang, the world... er... worlds that you come from

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#011]

I never really thought about what lies beyond Elyos.
What other continents are beyond the sea.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#012]

Perhaps in Elyos, yes, but aesthetics vary greatly by

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#014]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Thus I believe many others on foreign lands would

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#015]

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#020]

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#021]

I've only been able to help with Elusia's speedy
recovery mainly because of what he taught me.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#022]

So, I guess in a way I'm just trying to restore the

I'd refrain from doing that if I were in your

$Window(2, "PID_オルテンシア")
...$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#028]

I want Elusia to be a nation that doesn't need to
worry about war, unpredictability, or inside threats.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#029]
$Window(2, "PID_オルテンシア")
So basically... I want everyone in Elusia to be able
to live as they please so long as they do it peacefully.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#030]
$Window(2, "PID_Jingliu")
Very well. Hold onto that conviction and see to that
when you become an adult, you never let it falter.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#031]

I do have more to say on the matter but, this is not

Instead, since we have the rest of the day off, I

[MID_RELIANCE_A_#033]

Heh, like helping out in small ways, right? I never
thought about how effective that could be before.$Wait(0)

And I should be glad that I still have the opportunity

And if you can't, at least send him a letter so he

I'd assume that at his age, he might want some
alone time...$Wait(0)

get him a small gift while you're at it.$Wait(0)

In fact, I know a young boy your age who is in a

Yet he is trying too hard to prove himself to his
master by tracking down criminals and the like.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#064]

If he focused on his own training, like I believe
you should, then you'll be ready when you grow up.$Wait(0)

Heh, Lindon told me something similar.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#066]

[MID_RELIANCE_B_#067]

Elusia, but I gotta tell Ivy about these insurgents first.$Wait(0)

Do you not think yourself as a burden to your sister...$Wait(0)

Or do you feel yourself free from any responsibility
that you may hold?$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#016]

Hey, life's not that simple! Plus, you were a general
once, so you should know.$Wait(0)

[MID_RELIANCE_C_#017]

It's proper courtesy to be a good host and maybe
even an honor for a princess herself to do it.$Wait(0)

That was merely a jest, though your answer has
piqued my interest.$Wait(0)

I shall accept your offer just this once. In return,

Teach me?$Wait(0)

From my observations, you may have even greater
aptitude than your sister in many ways.$Wait(0)
